# Setup

## Requirements

Botfront has a few technical requirements. See them [here](/docs/deployment/configuration/#indicative-minimal-technical-requirements).

- Linux or macOS (Windows may work but is not officially supported yet, [help is welcome](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/issues/115))
- Chrome (some issues with other browsers)
- A recent version of Docker
- A recent version of Node.js

## Install the Botfront CLI

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

## Create a new project

```bash
botfront init
```

Botfront will prompt you for a folder name if the current directory is not empty

## Start Botfront

```bash
botfront up
```

When installation is completed, Botfront will propose you to create your first project.

At any time, you can access the Botfront menu to create or run a project by running `botfront` in your shell.

## Setup your project

<video autoplay muted loop width="740" controls>
  <source src="../../videos/setup.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


## Secure rasa access (optional)

You might want to secure the communication between botfront and rasa-for-botfront.

- In the instance settings there is a token, you can edit it or generate new ones as you feel.

- Add this token in env part of the botfront.yml under the key auth_token

- restart botfront (`botfront down` and then `botfront up`)

The rasa api is now protected !
